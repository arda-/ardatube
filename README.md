# ardatube
an opinionated wrapper for video sites, curing what I see as the main pain points of using their own interface:
- the goddamn video isn't ***FULL WIDTH***. c'mon youtube, why do you have such large padding?!?!
- there are no keyboard controls for **video quality** or **playback speed**
- comments, descriptions, and other features are often **distracting**
- the related videos have no quality indication (several browser extensions exist to solve this)
